Hall A E12-06-114 (45 sets) helicity independent and helicity dependent data.

The attached format file is:

xB Q2 t phi unp_xsec E(unp_xsec) Sys_high(unp_xsec) Sys_low(unp_xsec) diff_xsec E(diff_xsec) Sys_high(diff_xsec) Sys_low(diff_xsec)

E(unp_xsec) is the +/- statistical uncertainty for the unpolarized cross section (similar for the cross section difference)
Sys_low and Sys_high are the lower and upper point-to-point systematic uncertainties for each point.

In addition, one should add a 3% correlated systematic uncertainty to all unpolarized values and 3.2% to all helicity-dependent cross sections (this 3.2% should be replaced by 3.7% for values which have both xB<0.37 and Q2<3.2, due to a higher uncertainty in the beam polarization in this particular kinematic setting).

Here unp_xsec is: $\frac{d^{4}\sigma^{+} + d^{4}\sigma^{-}}{2}$,

and diff_xsec is: $\frac{d^{4}\sigma^{+} - d^{4}\sigma^{-}}{2}$
